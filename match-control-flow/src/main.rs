    // the power comes from the compiler enforcing that all cases are handled
    // At first sight it might seem similar to an if statement

    // the patterns are evaluated in order

    // ==== Patterns that bind to values
    // When a Coin::Quarter matches, the state variable will bind to the value of that quarterâ€™s state.
    // this is essentially binding the variable inside the match arm to the value attached to the enum variant.

    // ==== Matching Option<T>

    // ===== Matches are exhaustive
    // We will need to match all arms or else it will fail with an error
