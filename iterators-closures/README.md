## Definitions
- **Closures**: a function-like construct you can store in a variable
- **Iterators**: a way of processing a series of elements
Both Closures and Iterators are inspired by functional programming language ideas.

## Introduction
This Module covers: 
- How to use closures and iterators to improve the I/O project (minigrep)
- The performance of closures and iterators (they are faster than you think!)

Mastering closures and iterators is an important part of writing idiomatic, fast Rust code.
